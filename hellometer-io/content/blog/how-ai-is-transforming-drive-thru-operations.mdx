The drive-thru has always been the lifeblood of quick-service restaurants. It accounts for the majority of revenue at most QSR locations, and customers expect speed. But measuring and improving drive-thru performance has traditionally been a manual, inconsistent process.

## The Problem with Legacy Timers

Most drive-thru timer systems rely on pressure loops embedded in the pavement or simple pole sensors. These systems detect vehicle presence but tell you almost nothing about what's actually happening in the lane. They can't distinguish between a car waiting to order and a car stuck behind a slow transaction. They can't see when the kitchen is backed up or when a crew member steps away from the window.

The result: operators get a single number — average service time — that obscures more than it reveals.

## How Computer Vision Changes the Game

AI-powered computer vision brings a fundamentally different approach. Instead of measuring one moment in the process, it watches the entire journey from arrival to departure. This means operators can see:

- **Where delays actually happen** — Is it at the menu board? The payment window? The pickup window?
- **How the kitchen keeps up** — Are orders being prepared in time, or is the line backing up because of production bottlenecks?
- **Crew behavior patterns** — Are team members positioned correctly during peak hours?

All of this happens automatically, with no additional hardware on the crew and no manual observation needed.

## Real Results

Restaurants using AI-powered drive-thru analytics have seen meaningful improvements. On average, operators reduce wait times by **47 seconds** after getting visibility into where their bottlenecks are. That translates directly to revenue — industry research shows that every 7 seconds saved at the drive-thru can increase revenue by roughly **1%**.

The key insight is that the technology doesn't replace good management — it amplifies it. When operators can see what's happening across all their locations in real time, they make better decisions faster.

## Beyond the Drive-Thru

What started as a drive-thru solution is expanding. The same AI-powered visibility that helps operators optimize speed of service is now being applied to lobby operations, kitchen efficiency, and even loss prevention. The underlying principle is the same: give operators the data they need to run every location like the best one in the chain.
